# Open Tactics
Open Tactics is a tactics game built in Unity. The goals of this project are to serve as a practical, realworld playground for developing tools, editor extensions, and exploring unity code design patterns before future write-ups.

In other words, while working on things to *help* people work in Unity, I need to put myself back into their shoes.

## The Game

Gameplay looks like a classic turn-based tactics game, in the spirit of advance wars, into the breach, and wargroove. Except, instead of playing as a player, you play as a powerful deity whose moves nudge the outcome to the side you favor.

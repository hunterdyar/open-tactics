# Open Tactics
Open Tactics is a tactics game built in Unity. The goals of this project are to serve as a practical, realworld playground for developing tools, editor extensions, and exploring unity code design patterns before future write-ups.

> I was working on [Tilemap Pathfinding](https://github.com/hunterdyar/unity-tilemap-pathfinding-project) and hit a point where I either needed to put that playground in a proper package for use by others, or turn it into an actual game to keep adding features.
>
> This is that "actual game", and in the future, I plan to go back and extract the tilemap engine to it's own useful package.

In other words, I couldn't finish the thing to help developers, properly, without making it for a real-world project. 

## The Game

Gameplay looks like a classic turn-based tactics game, in the spirit of advance wars, into the breach, and wargroove. Except, instead of playing as a player, you play as a powerful deity whose moves nudge the outcome to the side you favor.
